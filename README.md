I have an extensive background working within the pharmaceutical industry as a lead clinical data analyst independently and within a diverse global team while managing complex relationships with a wide range of stakeholders. Transitioning from clinical data management to data science and programming with python. I am passionate about learning new approaches of analysis, interpretation, manipulation, and visualization of data. As an individual who strongly believes in success and continuously strives for growth, I recently completed a data science boot camp and currently pursuing further certifications in Backend Programming with Python and Machine learning.
